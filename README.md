Workout Tracking App

The intention of this app is give an easy and most importantly a free way to track your progress in the gym.
Most gym goers use notes, or another simillar app, to track their exercises along with reps, sets, and weight.
The problem that most lifters face is that they cannot track there progress but instead just 'overwrite'
the weights and sets they are doing. This app changes that. It allows users to see past progress and track
their improvements over time with ease, graphs.
